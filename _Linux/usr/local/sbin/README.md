This is the base directory for housing user custom supplied, non-critical,
system administrators (sysadmins) only programs and applications to extend its
functionalities from *Full Catalogue* stage to *Complete* stage. This means it
can operate in `Full Mode`.

stage, the OS can operate as per its distributor's engineering specifications
and customized as per user.

All programs and applications here are **ONLY** available to sysadmins and root
account.

Generally, you **SHOULD AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGED** to place your distributor's
unregistered programs here (e.g. from a custom package elsewhere). It will be
available to all users system-wide.

This directory **MUST NOT** have any sub-directory.
