# Common Filesystems

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the common filesystem abstracted from:

1. `FreeBSD` UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
2. `GNU+Linux` UNIX-like Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

The purpose is to have a common reference point and applied to anywhere
sensible across the operating system or a project repository (e.g. `git`).




## Primary Objective

The primary objective is to have a common understanding for common
directories whenever it is being used. Not only it speeds up the
learning process and inter-compatibilities enablement, it also helps
tidy up the directory layouts.

You can explore each directory here in details.
