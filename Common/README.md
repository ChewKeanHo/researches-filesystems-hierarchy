# Common Filesystems Layout

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the common filesystem abstracted from:

1. `FreeBSD` UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
2. `GNU+Linux` UNIX-like Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

The purpose is to have a common reference point and applied to anywhere
sensible across all applications such as but not limited to operating system's
directory layout or a project repository like `git` or `svn`.




## Primary Objective

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

The primary objective is to have a common understanding for these directories
whenever it is being used. Not only it speeds up the learning process but
also strengthens the inter-compatibilities capability while tidying up
the directory layouts.

You can explore each directory here in details.
