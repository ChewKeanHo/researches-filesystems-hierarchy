# `.internals`

This directory houses the project repository (e.g. `git`) internal working
resources like brand banners and logos that are not directly related to the
Project.

The naming is plural for seamless understanding (it has multiple internal
components).




## Dot (`.`) Naming Convention Prefix

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

The dot naming convention prefix is important to indicate this is the
project-specific directory. Hence, it is `.internals` not `internals`.
Some technologies (notably Go) uses `internal` or `internals` naming
convention to denotes its private directories.
