# `public`

This directory houses all static sites web pages content.

This is first introduced by Hugo.io (https://gohugo.io/) and later picked
up by many static site generator (SSG) programs.

Note that due to its data warehousing role, one must carefully work here to
prevent any data poisoning or losses.
