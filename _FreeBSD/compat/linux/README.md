This is the base directory housing all cross Linux-based operating systems (OS)
programs, applications, and files.

The goal is simple: to facilitate Linux-based operating systems' (OS) programs,
applications, and files in this OS.

This directory is **ENTIRELY OPTIONAL** depending on the use of cross
linux-based OS features.

You **SHOULD ONLY** place distributor's registered files in here only. The first
sub-directories layer denotes the origin OS.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

Like any executable programs and applications, on UNIX, the filename
**MUST BE THE SAME** as desired command.
