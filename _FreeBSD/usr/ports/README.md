This is the base directory for housing operating system's (OS) distributor
supplied, non-critical FreeBSD Ports Collections workspace. It facilitates a
simple way to compile and install third party applications and to build packages
installable using `pkg` command. This means it can operate in `Multi-User` mode.

The goal is to provide seamless OS-level customization capabilities for the
sysadmins and root account.

This directory is **ENTIRELY OPTIONAL** depending on user's use of FreeBSD Ports
Collections.

All files here are available to all users.

Generally, you **SHOULD ONLY** place FreeBSD ports collection workspace files
here.




## Naming Conventions
