# `/sbin`

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the base directory for housing system administrators (sysadmins)
only critical programs and applications of an operating system (OS) to
function properly and minimally without any mounting (e.g. `/usr` is not
mounted or absent). This means it can operate in `Single-User` mode.

The goal is to have minimally sufficient programs enough for basic
functionalities to perfrom critical tasks like mounting `/usr`
UNIX System Resources directory for functionalities extension, performing
self-rescue, or straight up operational in resources constraint environment
such as but not limited to OpenWRT embedded router.

All programs and applications here are **ONLY** available to sysadmins
(users in `wheel` group) and root account.

In some UNIX-like OSes like Oracle's Solaris (first to transform back in 2012)
and Red Hat's Fedora (second to transform back in 2023), due to `/usr`
is always being mounted and hardware are no longer seeing performance
differences between `/` and `/usr`, this directory is being symbolic linked
to `/usr/sbin` instead; unifying both directories. This reduces the separation
complexities while simplifying the package managements to target `/usr/sbin`
only. **FreeBSD however, have not seen to perform such implementation yet.**

Generally, you **SHOULD ONLY** place programs that are very critical at
early booting stage without conflicting with existing POSIX compliant
programs.

This directory **MUST NOT** have any sub-directory.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

All programs here are registered programs that are usable across all UNIX
and UNIX-like OSes (POSIX Compliant). Among them are:

```
shutdown - program to shutdown the operating system.
```

Optional programs (for robust functionalities) are:

```
fastboot - program to reboot the OS without checking the disk.
fasthalt - program to stop the OS without checking the disk.
fdisk    - program to configure partition table.
fsck     - program to check and repair a disk and partition.
fsck.*   - program(s) to check and repair specific disk and partition.
getty    - program to perform terminal robust configurations.
halt     - program to stop the OS.
ifconfig - program to configure a network interface.
init     - program to initialize the OS.
mkfs     - program to make filesystem format to a partition.
mkfs.*   - program to make specific filesystem format to a partition.
mkswap   - program to setup a swap area.
reboot   - program to reboot the OS.
route    - program to configure IP routing table.
swapon   - program to enable paging and swapping.
swapoff  - program to disable paging and swapping.
update   - program to flush filesystem periodically (daemon).
```
