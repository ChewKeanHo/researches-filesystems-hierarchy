This is the user-specific directory housing user supplied non-critical
user-specific configuration files for extending the operating system's
functionalities from complete stage to personalized stage. This means
that configurations in this directory only appears specifically for
this user.

Generally, you **SHOULD** place your own custom configuration files
here. It will be made available only for you.

The main purpose of such separation is to make sure the operating system's
update transaction goes smoothly without any conflicting files with yours.
The second purpose is to facilitate a way to procure programs and
applications without using sysadmins or root account that affects the
entire operating system.

This directory is **entirely optional** as it serves as a clean design
structure.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

It is a practice to house the configuration files using `trademark` and
`product` sub-directories organization. This can significantly reduces
the naming collision for common names.

The use of `.d` configuration directory strategy reduces the
configuration complexities and making maintainability easier by just
keeping 1 configuration per file. Then, the program would loop through
the directory and parse every files to reconstruct the setup.

Here are the examples with and without using `trademark` directory:

```
/home/USERNAME/.local/
  etc/
    trademark/
      product/
        settings.d/
          setting1.conf
          setting2.conf
          ...

# OR

/home/USERNAME/.local/
  etc/
    product/
      settings.d/
        setting1.conf
        setting2.conf
        ...
```
