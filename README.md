## Why Is It Required

[![banner](/.internals/icons/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This research project ultimate goals are for:

1. **Unifying Filesystems** - trying to simplify and unify as many FHS
   across operating systems as possible for maintenances, automations,
   documentations, and communications sake.
2. **Design References For Project Structuring** - something to refer
   (not a rule) when creating a project workspace directory.
3. **Maximizing Compatibilities, Minimizing Conflicts** - makes sure the
   project's repository's maintenances and automations are compatible
   with many OSes while leaving the directory structure freedom to the
   project.
4. **Project Repository Hygines** - ensures new products not polluting
   a project's repository with all the configuration files and etc.
