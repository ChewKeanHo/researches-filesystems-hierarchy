# Filesystems Hierarchy Layouts Research Project

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

Having trouble working with filesystems hierarchy layouts especially those
that has standardized regulations like UNIX and Windows? Are you looking
for some design references that are comforming and portable to as many
operating as possible? This is the right research dataset.

At (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Filesystems Hierarchy Layouts Research
Project, tech volunteers and me are continuously updating this repository
for abstracting common filesystems and directory layouts for various
purposes. The research goals are simple:

1. **Maximizing Compatibilities, Minimizing Conflicts** - analyzes and
   abstracts various standards for common patterns. Through these patterns,
   new projects can maximize inter-compatibilities across multiple operating
   systems and minimizing conflicts; AND
2. **Unifying Filesystems** - With common patterns in filesystems and
   directory organizations, packaging software for end-user can be simplified
   and unified for maintenances, automations, documentations, and
   communitions sakes; AND
3. **Solid and Hygienic Design References For Project Structuring** - something
   clean and reliable to refer (not a rule to enforce) when designing a project
   directory layout.
