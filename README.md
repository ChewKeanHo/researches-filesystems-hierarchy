This project is a continuous research of filesystem hierarchy layouts
from various design boards into a single reference points.

## Why Is It Required

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This research project ultimate goals are for:

1. **Maximizing Compatibilities, Minimizing Conflicts** - making sure the
   project's repository's maintenances and automations are inter-compatible
   across OSes while leaving the directory structure freedom to the project.
1. **Unifying Filesystems** - Simplify and unify as many filesystems
   as possible for maintenances, automations, documentations, and
   communications sake.
2. **Solid Design References For Project Structuring** - something to refer
   (not a rule) when designing a project directory layout.
4. **Project Repository Hygiene** - ensures new products are not polluting
   a project's repository with all the configuration files and etc.
