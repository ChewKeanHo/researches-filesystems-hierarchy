# Project Filesystems Layout

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the common filesystem used for project repository managements such
as but not limited to:

1. `git` version control software; AND
2. `svn` version control software.

This layout **ONLY CAPTURES** functional directories while leaving the
project workspace layouts free for users to design. All these directories
may or may not appear when used depending on the automation being used.




## Primary Objective

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

The primary objective is to have a common understanding for these directories
whenever they are being used in the project layout. Not only it speeds up the
learning process but also strengthens the inter-compatibilities capability
while tidying up the directory layouts.

You can explore each directory here in details.
