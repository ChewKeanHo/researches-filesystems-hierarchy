[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This directory houses an user's video files. The initial design was to let the
user houses all the movies and videos in this directory and let the media player
streams only from here. Expected files are `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.ogg`, etc.
