# User Directory Filesystems Layout

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the default user directory filesystems setup by various operating
systems (OS) such as but not limited to:

1. `GNU+Linux` Unix-like OS; AND
2. `FreeBSD` Unix-like OS; AND
3. `Windows` OS.

This layout **ONLY CAPTURES** the default directories design. It does not
defines the rules. Each user can use his/her own home directory at his/her
own discretion. Some savvy users alters the structures for his/her own ways
(e.g. some users combine `Videos`, `Musics`, and `Pictures` into `Galleries`
instead).

Usually, these directories are created when a graphical desktop manager (DM)
is enabled and it needs these directories for rendering purposes.




## Primary Objective

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

The primary objective is to have a common understanding for these directories
whenever they are being used in the project layout. Not only it speeds up the
learning process but also strengthens the inter-compatibilities capability
while tidying up the directory layouts.

You can explore each directory here in details.
