# `pkg`

This directory houses a release entry's entire package files readily to be
shipped out.

Release processes are also done here. The directory structure
**MUST BE FLAT** (no sub-directory) since a lot of release portals
(notably GitHub, Gitea, and GitLab) do not support sub-directories
structures.
